# NFL-Score-Tracker
Hi! This is a little personal project I am working on to practice http requests and my python. I get the chance to work on it every once in a while being a full-time student while working part time. As of now I still have a lot of features I want to add or atleast attempt to. 

## Requirements
In order to use this you must install requests and Beautifulsoup. I used requests for sending s get request to acquire the desired HTML, and then I used Beautiful soup to parse through the chaos.
